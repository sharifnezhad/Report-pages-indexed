# Report pages indexed

For large sites, the number of pages indexed by Google is difficult and time consuming for most SEOs.
I developed software with Python that makes this easier for SEOs and experts

## How to work with the software?

- Click on the "index-pages.exe" file
- Enter your site address without http
- After entering your site URL, a file in Excel type will be created in a folder called Excel and you can refer to that folder to see the results.
